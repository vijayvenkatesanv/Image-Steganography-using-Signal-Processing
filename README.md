# Image-Steganography-using-Signal-Processing
This project uses DWT and SVD for secure medical image steganography, ensuring confidentiality in transmitting X-rays, CT scans, and electronic health records. DWT enables frequency-based embedding, while SVD ensures robust data hiding and retrieval. This approach enhances security and resilience in medical data transmission.
